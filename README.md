### Abstract
Steady odor streams are typically encoded as robust spatiotemporal spike trains by olfactory networks. However, odorants often come riding upon chaotically pulsed plumes of air. As a consequence, the spike sequences must also be different every time an animal encounters the odorant. Nevertheless, animals are capable of decoding sensory cues and navigating highly complex and turbulent ‘odorscapes’. Here, we attempt to find the neural invariants of stable olfactory percepts in a computational model of the locust olfactory system. We show that when time-varying odor inputs intermittently perturb subsets of neurons in the antennal lobe network, the activity of the network reverberates in a manner that depends on both the nature of the inputs it receives and the structure of the neuronal sub-network that these inputs stimulate. We demonstrate that it is possible to decipher the structure of the perturbed sub-network by examining transient synchrony in the activity of the neurons. We find that the ability to reconstruct the sub-network structure is vastly improved when odor inputs arrive or are sampled in an intermittent manner. Thus, the structure of the stimulated sub-network itself serves as a unique invariant code that represents the odor.'
